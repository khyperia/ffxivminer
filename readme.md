FfxivMiner
===

This is very much some garbage I spewed out for myself and friends, but hey, if you find it interesting, neat I guess.

Deployed version can be found [here](https://khyperia.com/ffxivminer/). The data is probably suuuper out of date, I have to manually export from [universalis.app](https://universalis.app/) and I might not have done that for a while.

How to export data:

Download [SaintCoinach](https://github.com/xivapi/SaintCoinach/releases)

    SaintCoinach.Cmd.exe "D:\Games\ffxiv\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn" rawexd

(will take a while to run)

Take these files and copy them into the Data folder in the root of this project:

    Item.csv
    Recipe.csv
    RecipeLevelTable.csv
